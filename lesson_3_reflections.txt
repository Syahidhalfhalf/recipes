When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want other people to be able to edit the same file at the same time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Some changes may not be essential and are not needed eventually (only for testing or not working well). I may want to work on my
    own stuff and let others focus or work on the actual program.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are done on GitHub to clone a repository into your own account. Clones are done in the local repository or when
    copying it into the local repository for further editing. Branches are done in the local repository to split into (or try) 
    different functions.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
